# Simple window

![Simple window](screenshots/simple-window.png)

Lets start by building a *really* simple UI, containing just a button.
(This is basically just a template. [Source](https://github.com/kas-gui/tutorials/blob/master/examples/counter.rs).)

```rust
use kas::widget::{TextButton, Window};

fn main() -> Result<(), kas_wgpu::Error> {
    env_logger::init();

    let content = TextButton::new("Push me");
    let window = Window::new("Simple window", content);

    let theme = kas_theme::ShadedTheme::new();
    kas_wgpu::Toolkit::new(theme)?.with(window)?.run()
}
```

```sh
cargo run --example simple-window
```

Hopefully that is clear enough? Let me explain anyway:

-   our `main` function may fail with the `kas_wgpu::Error` type; `Toolkit::new`
    and `Toolkit::with` can fail (the `?` "try" operator)
-   we initialise a logger, [`env_logger`] (optional,
    but lets us get useful messages; try setting the environment variable
    `RUST_LOG=kas=info` or `trace` before running the example)
-   we construct a `TextButton` and a `Window` around that
-   we use the `ShadedTheme` (with default colours)
-   we initialise the toolkit with our theme, add our window, and run it

Note that `Toolkit::run` does not return. It is in fact a wrapper around
[`winit::event_loop::EventLoop::run`], which does not return.
By default, the program will exit after all windows have closed.

Also note that we only import our widgets into the module (`use kas::widget::{..}`),
but don't import anything from the other crates: we use [`env_logger::init`],
[`kas_theme::ShadedTheme`] and [`kas_wgpu::Toolkit`] directly since we don't need
any other items from these crates.

## Event handling

You may have noticed that the button used above doesn't *do* anything. Lets fix
that.

If you look at the [`TextButton`] docs, you'll notice that it has an `on_push`
method, allowing a closure to be set as a "push" event handler. This closure
must have the following type:
```
F: Fn(&mut Manager<'_>) -> Option<M> + 'static
```
In other words, it takes a reference to the [`Manager`] and returns an optional
*message* of type `M`. We'll come back to messages later; for now we can just
return `None` â€” well, we could if type inference worked, but since `None` could
be an option of any type we have to specify that we want `VoidMsg`:
```rust
let content = TextButton::new("Push me")
    .on_push::<VoidMsg, _>(|_| {
        println!("Hello!");
        None
    });
```

But let's not just print to the command-line: lets use the [`Manager`] to open
a message dialog!
```rust
    let content = TextButton::new("&Push me")
        .on_push::<VoidMsg, _>(|mgr| {
            let mbox = MessageBox::new("Message", "You pushed the button.");
            mgr.add_window(Box::new(mbox));
            None
        });
```

One final note: did you see we put an ampersand in `"&Push me"`? Try holding
`Alt` and pressing `P` when you run the example:

```sh
cargo run --example simple-window-handler
```
